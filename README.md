# Time_Series_examples


This project is a good sourse of better understanding on content-based and collaborative filtering based recommender systems. At the beginning, I provides the recommendations of the courses based on user profile and course similarity matrix and then user profile clustering. At last, different collaborative filtering models such as KNN, NMF, SVD, NN with embeddings have been developed and evaluated through Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). 
The main objective of the analysis is to focus on the recommender systems to build a better machine learning model to provide the personalized recommendations of the online courses.

## Discussion
This project provides a better understanding of different recommender systems to recommend the users focasing on their profile or items those they choose or combination of both of them.
